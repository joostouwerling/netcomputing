# Sports information management
This system is built by Joost Ouwerling and Erik Bijl for the course Net Computing 15/16 at the University of Groningen.

The basic idea is that sports players continuously send their location data to a data server. Coaches and other strategists of the team can then access this information using webservices to gather statistics and aggregrated data. In order of importance, we want to implement,

* heatmaps per player
* heatmaps per player in a time interval
* give feedback based on heatmaps to players
* total distance covered
* running speed over time
* statistics in relation to the other players
* filtering per game
